# Email Data Automation Python Script Documentation ATLAS Spring 2020 

##Overview
 The email script concatenates any amount of pdfs by appending the first page of each specified pdf to one another into one large combined pdf named ‘result.pdf’. After concatenating all the report pdfs into one, it converts all of the required data into a .txt file named ‘test.txt’. By using the xlwt Python to Excel library, the program will fill in the required text onto a new Excel spreadsheet called ‘emaildata.xls’ that is already formatted for you.
